-Broadened potential data to individuals with leukemia and specified the use of a random forrest
    ~1hr
-Wanted to find actual data for our project
-Found a couple of interesting articles, nothing substantive. finished progress report

Sun, Dec 4
    ~1.5hr
-Wanted to get the basic framework of our code done.
-Worked together to create random forest class and add trees function
    ~1hr
-wanted to continue working on our add tree method and others
-added predict, and display functions, and a load data function. Nothing worked, but scaffolding was set

Fri, Dec 9
    ~1hr
-Wanted to go over any questions that arose during development with Professor Linderman during our meeting
-Better understood how to approach random sampling of our data and how to potentially load the data. Need to work on predict and creating an eval function.

Sat, Dec 10
    ~2hr
-Wanted to implement changes and suggestions from previous meeting
-Worked together to updata the add trees function, did some work on our prediction, got stuck trying to figure out how to load in our data and emailed Pofessor Linderman

    ~1hr
-Wanted to implement change for reading in our data, test our forest functions and start experiments
-Predict function proved to be a major hurdle to understand the accuracy. 
    ~1hr
-Wanted to finish as many functions as possible
-Have most of the work done other than finished predict and eval function, emailed Professor Linderman for help

Mon, Dec 12
-Wanted to implement changes suggested by Professor Linderman and run experiments
-Got the diary done while Mead ran experiments and recorded data.
